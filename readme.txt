   +++ Working of ArtSplash +++

   A landing page serves as an attractive introduction to your company, showcasing its unique products and providing important information to your visitors. Make a strong first impression by effectively communicating your brand identity, location details, contact information and services offered.

The menu page provides visitors with a one-stop shop for exploring and navigating through the different categories of artwork available. With clear category selectors, artwork thumbnails, and filter options, visitors can easily browse and find their favorite styles and themes.

Catalog pages display all customizable graphic designs in each category. Thumbnail images, detailed artwork information, and navigation options allow visitors to explore each piece and make informed decisions.

Registration and login pages allow visitors to create user accounts, log in, and access personalized features. These pages feature user-friendly forms, verification mechanisms, and smooth navigation to enable a smooth onboarding process and ensure secure access to user profiles. 

A contact page acts as a communication channel, providing visitors with contact details, a contact form, and additional information to contact your company. This encourages open communication, encourages inquiries, and improves the overall user experience.
